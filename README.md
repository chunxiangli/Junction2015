Project Name: trip assistant


Motivation: For most of us, it is not easy to decide how to arrange a trip going through multiple cities.

To do that, we need make possible trip route first, search one by one and then compare the flight cost.

After that we could then search hotels, restaurants ...

Now, we could have an automatic trip arrangement tool to recommend flights, hotels, restaurants and tourist given destination cities.

APIs: Finnair + Helsinki Airport API
